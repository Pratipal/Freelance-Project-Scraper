# About

This repository pulls the projects posted by clients from PeoplePerHour and updates the [Freelance Platform Projects](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prtpljdj/freelance-platform-projects) dataset on Kaggle. I am using the Github actions for scheduling and running the python scripts.

Data collection started on January 20th, 2022, and adds approximately ~40 new projects to this dataset every hour.
